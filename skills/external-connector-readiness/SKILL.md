# External Connector Readiness

This is a Hermes-native `external-connector-readiness` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`external-connector-readiness` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and receive a structured, evidence-bounded OMH operating surface instead of ad hoc narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: external-connector-readiness compare weather plugin and wxtrain candidates with cost, freshness, multimodal evidence, and fallback routes before adoption.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_external_connector_readiness` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: external-connector-readiness silently enable a paid connector and claim weather, SQL, and screenshot results without observed provider evidence.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Candidate connector, target domain, read/write scope, modality needs, provider owner, fallback workflow, and stop condition are explicit.
- Cost, quota, credential, permission, live-data freshness, multimodal capture, safety, and compliance boundaries are marked ready, missing, risky, or not_observed.
- Route live read-only lookups to live-info-operator, external writes to connector-operator, datasets/SQL to data-analysis, and missing tools to toolbelt-readiness before claiming results.
- Provider responses, screenshots, audio/video/file captures, query outputs, message ids, and external mutations are reported only from observed trial evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the candidate list is unknown, route to skill-scout or source-finder before readiness scoring.
- If credentials, cost authority, or connector installation is missing, keep readiness blocked and route setup to toolbelt-readiness.
- If a specific provider action is already selected, route read-only live data to live-info-operator or write/mutation tasks to connector-operator.

## OMH Context Rail

- This skill is part of OMH's Hermes workflow layer, not a standalone executor.
- Product context: OMH is a Hermes-native workflow pack: choose skills, shape work, prepare artifacts, show status, and hand off with evidence boundaries.
- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+25 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If the user intent belongs to another OMH lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow instead of force-fitting this skill.
- Cross-skill context: every OMH skill: match lane; generic tool can render or execute.
- Generic-tool checkpoint: image->img-summary; frontend->frontend/a11y/visual-qa; paper->paper-learning; content->content-operator; media->media-input-operator; file->materials-package; search->web-research; live->live-info-operator; audit->workspace/production/security; failures->build-failure; verify->verification-gate; code->codegraph/onboarding/ultraprocess.
- Coverage: Every generated workflow skill carries this rail.
- Normal users talk to Hermes; OMH CLI is infra.
- Boundary: Prepared OMH routing, cards, handoffs, or artifacts are not observed execution, image generation, delivery, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Use When

Use before adopting, enabling, or routing an external plugin/connector/API when Hermes must compare capability, auth, cost, modality, freshness, safety, fallback, and observable trial evidence.

    Strong routing signals: `external-connector-readiness`, `external connector readiness`, `connector readiness matrix`, `plugin readiness matrix`, `provider readiness`, `api readiness`, `connector adoption`, `external plugin adoption`, `weather plugin readiness`, `weather connector readiness`, `wxtrain readiness`, `onequery read-only sql`, `read-only sql connector`, `sql connector readiness`, `nextcloud connector`, `microsoft workspace connector`, `microsoft graph connector`, `chainlink connector`, `solana connector`, `cost-aware connector`, `multimodal connector`, `multimodal routing`, `screenshot connector`, `audio connector`, `video connector`, `plugin auto-routing`, `connector auto-routing`, `external tool trial`, `커넥터 준비도`, `외부 커넥터 준비`, `외부 플러그인 채택`, `플러그인 준비도`, `비용 기준 커넥터`, `자동 라우팅`, `멀티모달 커넥터`, `멀티모달 라우팅`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `connector`
Phase: `connector-readiness`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- external_connector_readiness_card/v1
- connector_capability_matrix/v1
- auth_cost_boundary/v1
- live_data_freshness_policy/v1 when live data is required
- multimodal_routing_policy/v1 when screenshots, audio, video, or files are involved
- fallback_route_policy/v1
- connector_trial_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- external_connector_readiness_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- connector_capability_matrix/v1 with candidate, domain, read/write shape, modality, owner workflow, and fallback route
- auth_cost_boundary/v1 separating missing connector, missing credentials, paid/provider cost risk, quota, and user authority
- live_data_freshness_policy/v1 for requested recency, provider timestamp, stale-result handling, and source-quality thresholds
- multimodal_routing_policy/v1 for screenshot, audio, video, file, OCR, or visual QA evidence routes when needed
- connector_trial_manifest/v1 only when a provider response, capture id, query transcript, message id, or tool-call observation is recorded

Safety rules:

- An external connector readiness card is not connector installation, credential validation, provider access, API invocation, multimodal capture, live-data retrieval, external mutation, cost authorization, or successful trial evidence unless observed connector-trial evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Harness Discipline

- Start from the representative harness registry in `oh-my-hermes` when the workflow needs coding, research, planning, goal execution, architecture, critique, QA, or documentation lanes.
- Prefer richer evidence and clearer stop conditions over adding more workflow names.
- Use specialist lanes only when they change the quality of the answer or verification.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `external-connector-readiness`.

When local shell access or a bot wrapper is available, record metadata-only evidence:

```sh
omh runtime record --skill external-connector-readiness --harness external-connector-readiness --status started
omh runtime delegate --run <run-id> --requested --not-observed --result not_observed
```

Record observed delegation results when Hermes or the wrapper exposes them. If delegation is unavailable, keep the result explicit as `not_available` or `not_observed`.

## Hermes Compatibility Contract

- Preserve the workflow intent, stop conditions, and verification discipline.
- Use Hermes-native tools, file operations, and subagent/delegation features when available.
- Do not require runtime tools, role prompts, or overlays that Hermes Agent does not expose.
- Respect `omh_target_topology/v1` when a wrapper reports it: bind state to the current target/thread, adapt only the parts of this workflow that benefit from multiple Hermes agents, and fall back to single-target behavior when `active_agent_count` is one.
- When target topology changes from one to many or many to one, give a concise setup-change comment or use the wrapper's apply action before treating the new topology as persistent.
- Treat wrapper-supplied memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof that opaque Hermes memory was read or changed.
- When a runtime-specific mechanism appears in imported instructions, translate it to a Hermes-native artifact:
  - goal tools -> `.omh/goals/` ledgers, `goal_completion_gate/v1`, `goal_status_card/v1`, `goal_continuation/v1`, or explicit checklists with named next actions,
  - question renderers -> one concise question in the current Hermes interface,
  - native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes,
  - shell bridge commands -> optional bridge mode only.

## Execution Rules

1. Load supporting context with `skills_list` / `skill_view` when needed.
2. State the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
3. Keep progress evidence-backed.
4. Verify with the smallest relevant test or inspection before claiming completion.
5. If Hermes cannot provide a required runtime capability, say so and use the fallback above.
