# Ai Slop Cleaner

This is a Hermes-native `ai-slop-cleaner` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`ai-slop-cleaner` exists to keep `maintenance` work explicit, evidence-backed, and inside the Hermes/executor boundary instead of relying on ad hoc chat narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The goal is new or changed behavior rather than removing existing code; a plain refactor, feature, or fix request belongs to `ultrawork`.
- The cleanup would change architecture, module boundaries, or carry regression risk that needs a reviewed plan first; use `ralplan`.
- The user wants existing code judged rather than changed; use `code-review` for a bug-first review and `failure-signal-audit` for swallowed failures.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: $ai-slop-cleaner remove duplicated router branches and lock behavior with regression tests before refactoring.
- Expected behavior: Plan cleanup, preserve behavior, delete or simplify code, and prove it with targeted tests.
- Why: The request is maintenance cleanup with regression risk.

Bad example:

- Prompt: ai-slop-cleaner: treat casual chat or unaccepted work as if this workflow already produced verified results.
- Expected behavior: Ask a clarification question or route to a narrower workflow instead of forcing `ai-slop-cleaner`.
- Why: The request lacks the required inputs or would overclaim work that Hermes did not observe.

## Completion Checklist

- The selected coding or runtime owner is named before any implementation claim.
- Prepared handoff, dispatch, execution, verification, review, CI, and merge states are separated.
- The final status cites observed runtime evidence or keeps the work prepared_not_observed.
- When Hermes is the selected coding owner, use `hermes_coding_harness/v1` to keep builder, verifier, reviewer, docs, and PR lanes separate.
- Report the current harness stage, owner, next action, and missing evidence without claiming PR creation, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge until matching runtime observations exist.

## Recovery Notes

- If the selected executor is unavailable, ask for Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, or another runtime before retrying.
- If dispatch or result evidence is missing, keep the handoff prepared_not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Coding handoff** (`idea-to-deploy`, `cto-loop`, `deploy-and-monitor`, `code-review`, `build-failure-triage`, `verification-gate`, `security-safety-review`, `ultrawork`, `+6 more`) - coding owners, handoffs, review, CI, and merge evidence.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when the goal is removing existing low-quality, duplicated, or AI-generated code and the observable behavior must not change; lock behavior with tests before and after the edits.

    Strong routing signals: `ai-slop-cleaner`, `$ai-slop-cleaner`, `cleanup`, `deslop`, `refactor`, `risky`, `behavior-preserving refactor`, `risk analysis`, `refactor workflow`, `legacy refactor`, `리팩터링`, `리팩토링`, `위험 분석`, `변경 범위 제한`, `회귀 테스트`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `maintenance`
Phase: `cleanup`
Hermes role: `handoff-guide`
Quality tier: `regression-gated`
Reasoning demand: `heavy`

Quality bar:

- Lock current behavior with regression checks before non-trivial cleanup.
- Prefer deletion, reuse, and boundary repair over new abstractions.
- Rerun verification after cleanup before claiming behavior is preserved.

Handoff policy:

Use Hermes to define cleanup scope and regression checks; route behavior-preserving edits to the selected coding runtime once tests are clear.

Executor readiness:

- When accepted work mutates code, check `executor_readiness/v1` for the selected Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, or oh-my runtime path before first dispatch.
- If readiness is `missing` or `blocked`, ask the user to choose another coding agent, configure PATH, continue in Hermes, or keep a prompt/runtime handoff; retry only after that state changes.
- A readiness probe is not dispatch, implementation, verification, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

Delegation transparency:

- When delegating, show the composed delegate prompt in a fenced code block in the status message; truncate a long prompt to a bounded preview ending with `... [truncated, N chars total]` — the user must see WHAT was asked, not just that something was.
- Name every delegated or parallel lane's model and reasoning effort inline as `(model effort)` in status and briefing lines — including runtime-native subagents; write the literal `unknown` when the host does not expose a value, never empty parentheses, and carry token and elapsed figures the same way.
- Capture a resumable session or thread id at dispatch and report it in the status message: for non-interactive Claude Code pass `--output-format json` and read `session_id` from the result (resume with `claude -p --resume <session-id>`); for Codex pass `--json` and read `thread_id` (resume with `codex exec resume <thread-id>`, repeating `--skip-git-repo-check` outside a git repo). Never leave a delegate run with no recorded way to resume or steer it — a plain-text one-shot that hides its session id strands the work when the run stalls or times out.
- Before dispatch, grant the executor session every permission the task will need — file write/edit, command/test execution, and the working directory — on the dispatch command itself, not through settings-file guesses: for non-interactive Claude Code pass `--permission-mode acceptEdits` or an explicit `--allowedTools` list (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` only inside an isolated worktree or sandbox), and the equivalent sandbox/approval flags for other CLIs. `acceptEdits: true` is not a settings key and the home-directory `settings.local.json` is not a file Claude Code reads — user scope is `settings.json` under `~/.claude` and project scope is `settings.local.json` under `<dispatch cwd>/.claude` with rules under `permissions.allow`. Prove the grant with a bounded scratch-edit probe run before the real dispatch: a permission denial in a non-interactive run recurs identically on retry, so never redispatch until a changed grant is proven, and surface an ungrantable permission as a blocker before dispatch, not after minutes of silence.

Required inputs:

- target smell
- current behavior
- regression checks

Expected outputs:

- small cleanup diff
- before/after verification
- residual risk

Artifact expectations:

- cleanup plan and regression evidence for non-trivial work

Safety rules:

- Lock behavior with tests before risky cleanup.
- Prefer deletion and existing utilities over new layers.
- Do not add dependencies for cleanup unless explicitly requested.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `coding-handling`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill ai-slop-cleaner --harness coding-handling --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- When wrapper metadata includes `memory_review_card/v1` or `handoff_context_pack/v1`, treat it as reviewed OMH-local or wrapper-supplied context only. Use conflict-free context summaries to shape plans and handoffs, but do not claim Hermes internal memory was read or changed.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
