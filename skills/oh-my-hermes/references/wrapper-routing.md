# OMH Wrapper Routing

This reference is for Discord, Slack, hosted Hermes, plugin, or backend adapters. It is not normal end-user UX.

## Chat Routing

Wrappers can run `omh chat route` before dispatching a plain chat message to Hermes:

```sh
omh chat route --source discord --record "risky refactor"
```

Use `route.routing_prompt_template` with `{message}` replaced by the received chat message as the prompt forwarded to Hermes. If the wrapper wants a pre-expanded prompt, pass `--include-message` and forward `route.routing_prompt`.

Prefer `omh_interact` when the plugin/tool surface is available because it returns `chat_interaction/v1` and can record a metadata-only wrapper session. Use `omh_recommend` only when Hermes needs route hints without a session record. The plugin-authored metadata has producer provenance so it stays distinguishable from wrapper/backend metadata.

Do not make a normal chat user approve `omh list`, `omh recommend`, `omh chat interact`, or other backend commands just to see workflow options. Render compact summaries, context briefs, pickers, quickstart, probe, or status cards instead.

## Coding Delegation

When a chat message is implementation-shaped and a wrapper wants a concrete executor handoff, run `omh coding delegate` after or instead of generic chat routing:

```sh
omh coding delegate --source discord --executor codex --record "risky refactor"
```

The payload is deterministic local adapter data: recommended workflow, harness, executor/runtime profile, acceptance criteria, verification expectations, and handoff prompt template. Hermes still narrates the user-facing state.

Check `executor_readiness/v1` for Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, or oh-my runtime profiles before first dispatch. If readiness is `missing` or `blocked`, ask the user to choose another coding agent, configure PATH, continue in Hermes, or use prompt/runtime handoff; retry only after that state changes. A readiness probe is not dispatch, execution, verification, review, CI, or merge evidence.

With `--record`, Codex-selected real executor handoffs create `.omh/runtime/runs/<run-id>/` prepared runtime runs with `observation_status: prepared_not_observed`. Executor-choice, prompt-only, runtime-handoff, clarify, and fallback responses remain wrapper/session state.

## Large Output And Context Safety

Wrappers must keep raw Codex JSONL, tool output, process logs, and oversized
executor notes out of Hermes chat context. Use `omh chat codex-progress` or the
Codex progress fields on executor-session actions to pass only
`codex_progress_summary/v1`, `omh_context_artifact_ref/v1`, compact evidence
refs, and bounded human-readable summaries. Raw output belongs in a wrapper or
operator artifact store referenced by `raw_output_artifact`; a prepared artifact
reference is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Memory And Planning

Wrappers can run `omh memory inspect`, `omh memory pack`, and `omh memory apply` to review OMH-local or wrapper-supplied context before preparing a handoff. This emits `memory_review_card/v1` and `handoff_context_pack/v1` artifacts only; it does not read or mutate opaque Hermes internal memory.

For planning-shaped requests, wrappers or operators can run `omh hermes plan` to create a deterministic `hermes_plan/v1` scaffold. The stdout `wrapper_contract` is the adapter contract for follow-on work; use it instead of parsing Markdown.

## Backend Boundary

This is a deterministic wrapper-side decision layer. By default, stdout and runtime artifacts avoid duplicating the raw prompt body. It does not patch Hermes core or require platform network access from `omh`.
