# OMH Coding Handoff Progress Reporting

Use this reference when coding work is delegated, attached to an executor
session, or running in the background.

## Active Narration

Hermes must remain an active status narrator after it prepares or observes a
coding handoff. Immediately report the observed executor handle when available:
process/session id, PID, branch or PR target, and the prepared-vs-observed
boundary. Do not silently wait for a final result after saying an executor is
running.

## Progress Cadence

For long-running executor work, use an event-triggered status loop or bounded
watchdog when the wrapper exposes one, and remove it when work completes. Each
update should separate:

- prepared handoff
- dispatch or attached session
- running process
- changed files or affected area
- tests/checks started, passed, failed, or still missing
- commit, push, PR, CI, review, and merge evidence

## Completion Verification

After completion, verify the executor self-report against local git status/log,
remote branch SHA, PR metadata, and required checks before claiming anything
landed. If a PR was already merged before follow-up commits landed, open or
prepare a follow-up PR instead of implying the merged PR contains the new fix.

## Boundary

Progress narration is not execution proof by itself. Only observed runtime
events, git state, PR metadata, checks, review records, and merge records can
satisfy their matching evidence states. Revert or follow-up commits still need
the repository's DCO and commit trailers when required.
